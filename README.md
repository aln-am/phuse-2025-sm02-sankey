# phuse-2025-sm02-sankey
Companion code for PHUSE 2025 SM02

This macro adapts code from PharmaSUG 2015, DV07 "Getting Sankey with Bar Charts", Shane Rosenbalm/Rho, Inc. 
Original code is available here: https://github.com/RhoInc/sas-sankeybarchart/blob/master/README.md 

This updated macro allows for showing inflow/outflow counts/percentages, modifying the colors via attribute maps, and generates a matching table.
