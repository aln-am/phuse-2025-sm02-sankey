Companion code for PHUSE 2025, SM02 "Improvement on Sankey Diagram SAS Macro and Implementation" 
https://www.lexjansen.com/phuse-us/2025/sm/PAP_SM02.pdf

This macro adapts code from PharmaSUG 2015, DV07 "Getting Sankey with Bar Charts", Shane Rosenbalm/Rho, Inc. 
Original code is available here: https://github.com/RhoInc/sas-sankeybarchart/blob/master/README.md 

This updated macro allows for showing inflow/outflow counts/percentages, modifying the colors via attribute maps, and generating a matching table.
